### Goal System Events Detected

#### 1. Goal Formation âœ“
```json
{
  "step": "goal",
  "label": "goal_formed",
  "data": {
    "goal": "I want them to understand that their hesitation may be rooted in deeper fears about responsibility and loss, and that these fears can be addressed rather than avoided.",
    "real_issue": "They are struggling with the commitment and responsibility that comes with owning a dog, possibly stemming from previous experiences with pets or a fear of failure."
  }
}
```

#### 2. Progress Assessment âœ“
```json
{
  "step": "goal",
  "label": "progress_assessed",
  "data": {
    "engagement": "engage",
    "progress": 30,
    "strategy": "deepen_current"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Goal-Driven Prompt âœ“
```json
{
  "step": "prompt",
  "label": "goal_prompt_built",
  "data": {
    "strategy": "deepen_current",
    "prompt_len": 1488
  }
}
```

## Timeline
- **Goal check**: 627ms - No existing goal found
- **Goal formation**: 627ms â†’ 6020ms (6 seconds) - LLM call to form goal
- **Progress assessment**: 6020ms â†’ 9038ms (3 seconds) - LLM call to assess engagement
- **Prompt building**: 9038ms â†’ 9159ms (instant) - Strategy-specific prompt built
- **First token**: 10079ms from start
- **Total response**: 10207ms (50 chars)

## Verification Status: PASSED

All three core goal system components are functioning:
1. âœ“ Goal Formation - Creates meaningful goals from conversation context
2. âœ“ Progress Assessment - Evaluates user engagement and adjusts strategy
3. âœ“ Goal-Driven Prompts - Builds strategy-specific system prompts

### What Shows in UI

The debug panel will display these as `debug_step` events:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal Formed** (first message only)
- ðŸ“Š **Goal Progress** (every subsequent message)
- ðŸ’¬ **Goal-Driven Prompt** (every message)

### Notes
- Test passed functionally but encountered Windows console emoji encoding issues (non-critical)
- Goal system adds ~9 seconds of latency for first message (2 LLM calls)
- Subsequent messages will only have progress assessment (~3 seconds)
- Frontend already handles `debug_step` event type
